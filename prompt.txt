I have a VB.NET ASP.NET (.NET Framework) application running on IIS in AWS EC2.

Environment:
- Single EC2 instance
- Single IIS server
- Multiple IIS Application Pools
- Applications hosted on:
    app1.company.com
    app2.company.com
- Cookie authentication must be shared across subdomains
- Security policy does NOT allow using <machineKey>
- Must pass enterprise insurance security audit

Requirements:
1. Do NOT use machineKey
2. Do NOT store cryptographic keys in web.config
3. Support shared cookie across subdomains
4. Support multiple App Pools
5. Use strong cryptography (RSA 2048+ / AES 256)
6. Allow future scale to multiple EC2 instances
7. Follow secure key management best practices

Please design:
- Secure architecture
- Data protection strategy
- Certificate-based encryption approach (Hybrid AES + RSA)
- Sample VB.NET implementation of IDataProtector
- Proper CookieAuthenticationOptions configuration
- Key rotation strategy
- IIS permission configuration
- Security justification for audit documentation
